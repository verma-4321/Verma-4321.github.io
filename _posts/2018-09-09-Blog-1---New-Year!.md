    <td>When we first started out I used past experience on Google sheets from other lessons to get a head start. After doing this I started to recall memories of when I was using it last  From this I was able to work swimmingly as I knew the basis if how everything worked. Also while cracking the Code Mr Tansley had given us, I used trial and error. I managed to work out the code using teamwork when my friend and I helped each other out.</td>

    <td>While we were trying to crack the code I kept spending too much time on the same methods that I was thinking of, if I were too have accepted that some of them don't work earlier then I could have made more progress in a lesser amount of time/</td>
